## Biography

Professor Cyril Ponnamperuma was born in Sri Lanka on 16 October 1923.
He received his early education at Piyarathana College in Dodanduwa, Galle
and later enrolled at St. Aloysius' College, Galle.
After completing his early education with flying colours at St. Aloysius' College, Galle and
subsequently at St. Joseph's College, Colombo, Ponnamperuma proceeded to India and in 1948 obtained
a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy from the University of Madras.

Later he moved to the United Kingdom and enrolled at Birkbeck, University of London,
where he obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry in 1959.
At the same time he had the opportunity to work with Professor J. D. Bernal,
a pioneering scientist engaged in research on the origin of life.
Afterwards he proceeded to the United States, where in 1962 he received a
Doctorate in Chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley under the direction of
the Nobel Laureate Melvin Calvin.

In 1962, he was honoured with a National Academy of Sciences Resident Associateship with
NASA at Ames Research Center.  In 1963 he joined NASA's Exobiology Division and took over
the helm of the Chemical Evolution Division.  He was selected as the principal investigator for
analysis of lunar soil brought to Earth by Project Apollo.

Thereafter, he was closely involved with NASA in the Viking and Voyager programmes and
was offered membership in both the Space Science Advisory Council and Life Sciences Advisory Council
of NASA.

According to Arthur C. Clarke, "No other scientist of Sri Lankan origin was internationally known
and respected as he was".  He produced over 400 scientific publications and held a number of
prestigious academic posts during his rather short lifespan.

His studies focused mainly towards the origin of life, but only after he was selected
for the analysis of the Moon dust in the 'Apollo Programme' his name and photo appeared on
the cover-pages of world class newspapers and magazines such as Time and Newsweek.

The "Third World Academy of Sciences" (TWAS) based in Trieste, Italy, elected him as its
Vice President in 1989 and appointed him Chairman of the International Network of Science Centres
in selected developing Countries.  He contributed immensely to the Third World Foundation of
North America as its chairman.

He was the first director of the "Arthur C. Clarke Centre for Modern Technologies" in Sri Lanka,
and in 1984 was appointed science advisor to the president of Sri Lanka by the late President
J. R. Jayewardene.  He was associated with many universities in the US and other countries.
He served as a distinguished lecturer at the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the
Chinese Academy of Sciences for a considerable period.

The Atomic Energy Commission of India offered him an assignment as a visiting professor in 1967.
UNESCO appointed him for a period covering 1970â€“1971 as its director of the programme for
the development of basic research in Sri Lanka.  After that, in his endeavour to widen the
horizon of knowledge of the fellow human beings the distinguished academic apex he selected was
University of Maryland in the US.  Since 1971 he provided his service to that university
as a professor of chemistry as well as the director of the laboratory of chemical evolution.

His contribution to the development of international programmes of that university was acknowledged
in deserved manner in January 1991, the first distinguished International Service Award
was presented to him by that university.  Among the many awards that Professor Ponnamperuma
received one can mention the "Alexander Oparin Gold Medal" for the 'Best Sustained Programme'
on the origin of life awarded by the International Society for the study of the origin of life in 1980.
In recognition of his service to Sri Lanka, he was conferred, "The Honour of Vidya Jyothy"
at the 1990 National Day investiture ceremony by President Ranasinghe Premadasa.

The presence of this great son of Sri Lanka, was so conspicuous all over the world as to be nominated
to the prestigious Pontical Academy of Sciences, a body represented by world-renowned scientists
who excelled in the spheres of mathematical and experimental sciences.

The Academy of Creative Endeavors, Moscow, awarded him the Harold Urey Prize and the Academy Medal
for his outstanding contribution to the study of the origin of life.

His participation in the Sri Lankan scientific arena began in 1984, when he became the Science Adviser
to the late Sri Lanka President J. R. Jayewardena.  Within a matter of months he was appointed
Director of the Institute of Fundamental Studies.

Sri Lanka was fortunate to have a son so highly recognized in the world and so dedicated to many
public causes. His organisational abilities and communication skills have been widely acknowledged.

He died soon after suffering a heart attack at the Laboratory of Chemical Evolution,
University of Maryland USA.

The remains of Professor Cyril Ponnamperuma were flown to Colombo on 9 January 1995.
